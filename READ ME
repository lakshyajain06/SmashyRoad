Smashy Road Instructions

This is basically just a car game. 
You drive the car using the arrow keys. 
The car automatically accelerates forward so you just use left to turn left, right to turn right, and back to go backward. 
Cop cars will chase after you and the longer you survive, the higher your score. 
You can also get a higher score by destroying the cops which can be done by crashing into them. 
If you crash with cops, you lose HP too and once you deplete your HP, the game ends. 
The red bar in the top left is your HP
the score is in the top right

This game does have a bug where occasionally, you will see cars clipping into each other. 
If it doesn't automatically fix itself after you try moving around a bit, just restart the game
Also, I did not have enough time to create a map with boundaries so I just brute forced a very large playing area made up of green squares.
So you are able to exit the playing area if you keep going in the same direction
